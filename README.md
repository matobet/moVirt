###User's guide:    
After successfully installing the application, you need to set the **connection details** up:

* **API URL**: http://host:port/ovirt-engine/api
* **Username**: name@domain - e.g. admin@internal
* **Password**: your password
* **Admin Privilege**: enable or disable the checkbox
* **Advanced Settings**: certificate management

Also you can set **optional settings**:

* **Poll Events**: enable or disable the checkbox
* **Connection Notifications**: enable or disable the checkbox
* **Periodic Sync**: enable or disable the checkbox
* **Sync Interval**: configure the polling interval in minutes
* **Max events locally**: the maximum number of events stored locally  
* **Events Search Query**: poll events for the search query. Admin users only. - e.g. severity > warning  
* **Max VMs polled**: maximum number of VMs polled.  
* **VMs Search Query**: poll VMs for the search query. Admin users only. - e.g. name = "production"

####Remote console
Follow these steps to connect to remote console:

#####VNC
* Install bVNC from Google Play
* Click console button in VM Detail view

#####SPICE
* Install aSPICE(v3.7.7+) from Google Play Store
* Click console button in VM Detail view

####Augmented Reality  
You can use your smartphone/tablet camera to help managing your servers. Follow these steps to access augmented reality:

1. Generate Data Matrix codes for each host you running (this step will be simplified in future).
  * Open `http://host:port/ovirt-engine/api/hosts` in your browser and find host ID.  
    <img src = /images/data_matrix_guide/Screenshot_1.jpg align="center">
  * Make data matrix codes with any online generator containing these IDs as a text (one code for each ID).

2. Print and stick codes to physical servers.
3. Open Scan Codes option in moVirt and you are ready.
